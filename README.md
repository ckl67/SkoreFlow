# 🎼 SkoreFlow

> **From upload to structured music data — cleanly processed.**

SkoreFlow is a backend and frontend application designed to manage, process, and serve musical scores through a clean, scalable, and layered architecture.
SkoreFlow is the result of several iterations on earlier experimental projects, redesigned with a focus on clean architecture, scalability, and maintainability.

Full test chain with

- vitest backend and frontend
- Mock Service Worker
- ..

So welcome to SkoreFlow 🎉

## 🚀 Overview

SkoreFlow provides a structured pipeline to:

- Upload and manage score music files
- Organize scores, composers, and users
- Process files (storage, thumbnails, normalization, score annotations)
- Expose a robust REST API for frontend and integrations

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
.

├── backend
├── config
├── docs
├── frontend
├── node_modules
├── shared
├── testauto


```

## 📦 Monorepo Architecture

This project uses a **npm workspaces monorepo**.

All JavaScript/TypeScript dependencies are managed **centrally at the root level**, using a single `node_modules` directory.

### Key Principles

- A **single root `node_modules/`**
- Multiple isolated projects (workspaces)
- Shared tooling (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest)

### Workspaces

```bash

SkoreFlow/
├── node_modules/ ✅ unique
├── package.json ✅ workspaces
├── backend/              # Go backend
├── frontend/             # React (Vite)
│ └── package.json
├── testauto/
│ ├── backend/
│ │ └── package.json
├── docs/

```

📌 Rules to Follow

- Always run npm install from the root
- Always specify the workspace using -w
- Never create a local node_modules inside subprojects !
- Common tools must be installed on the root
  - Prettier / ESLint → root
  - Vitest → testauto/backend
  - React → frontend
